Topic	OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)	OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)	PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
Threat Modeling	OWASP provides a focus on identifying and classifying threats, as well as attack surface identification.	OSSTMM emphasizes identifying operational risks and classifying threats based on business impact.	PTES incorporates threat modeling to identify high-priority attack vectors.
Information Gathering	Passive and active reconnaissance, such as fingerprinting, DNS enumeration, and WHOIS lookups.	Detailed approach to information gathering with a focus on minimizing exposure during recon.	Detailed recon including network mapping, DNS recon, open-source intelligence (OSINT).
Authentication Testing	Focus on weak authentication mechanisms, broken authentication, and session management flaws.	Authentication process verification, testing for weak or default credentials.	Covers testing for weak credentials, password policies, and session management flaws.
Authorization Testing	Explores privilege escalation, improper access control, and IDOR vulnerabilities.	Analysis of user roles, permission checks, and access control mechanisms.	Similar to OWASP, tests improper authorization controls and access levels.
Session Management	Includes session fixation, session hijacking, cookie management, and token validation.	Examines session control mechanisms, tokens, and cookie security.	Includes tests for insecure session management, hijacking, and token flaws.
Input Validation and Data Sanitization	Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and input filtering mechanisms.	Emphasizes how input/output validation impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.	Focuses on testing input validation controls to identify injection points and XSS.
Configuration and Deployment Management	Covers improper server configurations, outdated software, and default settings.	System hardening and configuration testing to reduce attack surface.	Includes testing for misconfigurations, security controls, and default setups.
Business Logic Testing	Looks into logic flaws that attackers can exploit (e.g., improper flows, bypassing workflows).	OSSTMM handles business processes, focusing on non-technical threats.	PTES includes understanding business processes to find exploitable logic flaws.
Testing for Client-Side Attacks	Includes DOM-based XSS, Clickjacking, and local storage attacks.	Tests for attacks that manipulate the client-side data and interact with the server.	Focuses on testing vulnerabilities affecting client-side code such as XSS and DOM manipulation.
Cryptography Testing	Analyzes weak encryption algorithms, incorrect usage of cryptography, and SSL/TLS flaws.	Checks the implementation of encryption and adherence to cryptographic best practices.	Focuses on testing for weak encryption, improper implementation, and missing encryption.
Error Handling	Tests for information leakage through verbose error messages.	Tests the effectiveness of error handling and logging practices.	Focuses on testing error messages that might reveal sensitive information.
File and Resource Access Testing	File inclusion vulnerabilities (LFI/RFI), improper directory permissions, file upload flaws.	Tests access to files, directories, and resources to identify improper access control.	Includes directory traversal, improper access to resources, and file upload flaws.
Testing for Injection Flaws	SQL injection, LDAP injection, Command injection, NoSQL injection, etc.	Tests various injection vulnerabilities and the validation of user inputs.	Similar to OWASP, testing for SQLi, Command injection, and other injection flaws.
Web Services Testing	SOAP, REST API testing, XML external entity attacks (XXE), API authentication issues.	Covers web services, focusing on how input is handled by APIs.	Focuses on web services and API testing for common vulnerabilities such as XXE and insecure API endpoints.
Client-Side Testing (Mobile)	Analyzes mobile-specific vulnerabilities, hybrid apps, and API interactions.	Mobile device security and interaction between mobile apps and servers.	Tests for vulnerabilities in mobile apps interacting with web services or APIs.
Denial of Service (DoS) Testing	Tests for DoS vulnerabilities, resource exhaustion, and application overload.	Analyzes resilience against DoS attacks and stress testing.	Similar to OWASP, includes testing for potential DoS issues and resource starvation.
Social Engineering	OWASP doesn't typically cover this in web app-specific guidelines.	Emphasizes testing for social engineering risks as part of operational security.	PTES includes social engineering attacks such as phishing to manipulate users.
Post-Exploitation	Not deeply covered in web testing, though OWASP ZAP can help identify flaws leading to privilege escalation.	OSSTMM handles post-exploitation from a risk management perspective, focusing on recovery.	Includes gaining higher privileges and extracting sensitive data in the post-exploitation phase.
Reporting	OWASP provides templates for issue reporting and documentation best practices.	OSSTMM offers detailed methodologies for creating risk-oriented reports.	PTES provides standardized reporting guidelines based on the test's findings.
Vulnerability Scanning	OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite for automated scanning, manual testing recommendations.	OSSTMM suggests using automated scanners and manual verification methods.	Similar to OWASP, PTES integrates vulnerability scanning tools into the testing process.
